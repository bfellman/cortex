# Cortex Thought Processing System

## Intro
The Cortex system enables user to store snapshots of their thoughts in remote server, for further processing and storage.
The system simulates a [client](#client) uploading data (as the hardware device doesn't exist yet), and implements a remote [server](#server) communicating with a variety of [parsers](#parsers) through a [message queue](#message-queue)
Parsed results are [stored to a database](#saver), exposed by a [web API](#web-api) and can be accessed by a [CLI](#cli)

```
Then install and activate:
```bash
$ cd cortex
$ ./scripts/install.sh
â€¦

[cortex] $ 
```
### Requirements
- `docker` for running message queue and database
- `python3.8`, `virtualenv` and `pip` 

## System Components
### Client
The client expect to receive a sample protobuf file, where the first message is the User information, and the rest are snapshots. 

### Server

### Message Queue

### Parsers

### Saver
